Got it! Using handshaking signals simplifies the design and is a good fit for a simpler router design. With this approach, you'll use ready and valid signals to manage flow control between modules.

Updated Module Breakdown
Hereâ€™s how you can structure the modules for handshaking signals:
1. VC (Virtual Channel Module)
Function: Manages two 8-bit FIFOs as VCs.

Key Tasks:
Stores incoming flits.
Provides the ready signal to indicate if the FIFO can accept more flits.
Forwards flits to the switch module when the head-of-line flit is ready.


2. Switch Module
Function: Forwards flits from the input VCs to the correct output port based on routing decisions.
Key Tasks:
Performs switching based on routing.
Manages contention if multiple inputs request the same output.
Interfaces with the controller for routing decisions and flow control.


3. Controller (Routing and Flow Control)
Function: Handles routing decisions and flow control.
Key Tasks:
Routing: Determines the output port for each flit based on static routing.
Flow Control: Manages ready and valid signals. This includes generating ready signals to inform the upstream router if the switch module or VC can accept more flits.


4. Switch Controller
Function: Manages the switching logic.
Key Tasks:
Handles arbitration and switching of flits from multiple VCs to multiple output ports.
Integration: If the switching logic is simple, you might include this logic in the switch module itself or combine it with the main controller. If more complex, keep it as a separate module.
Handshaking Signal Flow


Input to VC Module:
Valid Signal: Indicates that a flit is present and ready to be stored.
Ready Signal: Indicates if the VC module can accept a new flit.

VC Module to Switch:
Valid Signal: Indicates that the head-of-line flit is ready to be forwarded.
Ready Signal: Indicates if the switch module can accept the flit.

Switch to Output:
Valid Signal: Indicates that the flit is available to be sent out.
Ready Signal: Indicates if the output can accept the flit.
